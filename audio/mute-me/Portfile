description         Use the touch bar, a menubar icon or a keyboard shortcut to mute/unmute your Mac's microphone.

long_description    When you're in a meeting using Hangouts, Skype, Slack, or another voice application, it's good \
                    practice to stay on mute until someone speaks to you directly - especially if you're meeting with \
                    three or more people. Often, however, you'll need to browse between multiple tabs, and it can \
                    take too long to switch back to the meeting app to unmute your microphone. With Mute Me, you can \
                    mute or unmute your mic quickly and easily, right from your Touch Bar.
